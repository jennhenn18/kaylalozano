**Stuff to know about me:**
 
   1. I generally work 9-5pm but occasionally shift this up or down depending on project need and personal commitments.
   2. I like to leverage the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) in order to continually gut-check urgency versus significance to best focus my time and energy on the right things
   3. I have a high value for efficiency and organization. If I notice a process that can be improved to either allow for a higher level of efficiency or provide space for better cross-collaboration and team relationship, then I will probably suggest an process upgrade. 
   4. I am generally a self-starter and don't require micro-management. 
   5. I value progress over perfection. 
   6. I always welcome feedback. I will, more than likely, actively ask for feedback and seek out the right people to have goals and growth conversations with as I find those conversations energizing. 
   7. I strive to balance being present, while always being a forward-thinker. 
   8. I care most about what is best for the user. Sometimes, what is best for the user is not what is easiest for internal politics. If I notice a mismatch between the two, I will likely want to partner with leadership to brainstorm how we can influence culture change together to better align. 
   9. I love being the glue. Bringing teams together to align on goals and process. Improving workflows. Adapting process and presentations to accommodate higher levels of cross-team collaboration. Measuring and monitoring success. These are fun challenges. 
   10. I believe the most successful PMs are **relational**, big-picture thinkers with a dedication to the details required to align teams and projects to measurable, research-based business goals and outcomes.


**Fun Facts:**   
   1. I am a tango and bachata dancer. When I am not working or with family, I am most likely on the dance floor. 
   2. One of the most fun projects I have worked on was as a product manager for a startup working in the healthcare IP space. I worked with the team that designed the AR dashboard for the hyperloop to design a AR software prototype to aide spinal surgeons in the operating room. 
   3. My family is Argentine so, yes, we love to eat and be with family.
