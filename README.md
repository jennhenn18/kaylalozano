**Stuff to know:**
 
   1. I generally work 9-5pm but occasionally shift this up or down depending on project need and personal commitments.
   2. I believe in the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/)
   3. I have a high value for efficiency and organization. If I notice a process that can be improved to either allow for a higher level of efficiency or provide space for better cross-collaboration and team relationship, then I will probably suggest an process upgrade.
